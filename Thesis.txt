Abstract.

So, why am i writing this ? the casual answer to things one hate is "don't watch then". This is reasonable,
if you don't like something, then don't look. then what could I hope by taking a study then ? 
One thing, by analysing what I hate, I could get into deeper touch with myself, so it serves as a personal 
maturation exercise. But the reasoning, I hope, is entertaining for all, also serves as motivation.
Finally, the study may reveal a common underlying character sets that resent a manifestation, that is me, therefore can serve while generalizing to an arbitary manifestation.

Definition: Itouness

0. Itou, Makoto - from "School days" 

    Reason: 
		Greed. 

    Remark : 
		Itou is a standard of hatred for a character. It is very much impossible to come up with a character more hatable 
than Itou. Thus, we can define Itouness of a character, which describes the relative ratio of hatred one can have for a character.

Application of the concepts onto real-world characters.
------------------------------------------------------

1. Yamabuki, sho - from "so many colours in the world"

Reason:	 
		greed for wanting the beauty from future, likes to dominate women by asking them 
to follow his footsteps, ignoring his childhood friend. for trying to be overly friendly with 
people. Also for not keeping it in control and bursting it out. How shameful ?? 
		Ep 9. 10.33 - 10.41 is the one of the most shameful sequences of the anime. what the hell ??? 

	One of his statement:  "how would I know if you ask me out of now where ???" 

	what do you mean ? is it ( you like him but he asked out of sudden and ) you slipped, 
	
	this is not good for my rage. not at all.
	
Itouness - 40%


2. Tachibana, Akira and Kondo, Masami. - from "Koi wa Ameagari no You ni" 

Reason: 	
			the inability of tachibana to look at people around her to find solutions and looking at 
the "wrong" places and people is annoying. and kondo is guilty of letting her be. Honestly, he is some 40yr old, she is abt 18 yrs old. this is wrong seriously stop it. You can't let clumsiness and seriousness get away 
with anything.

Itouness - 75%

3. Kyougoku, Ryouichi - from "Nerawareta Gakuen"
	
	Reason: 
		 for being so cool that the most beautiful girl harukawa has a crush on him. Every cute thing that she does to even avoid him
is so cruel. He does follow the rules of romanticism, so the mb girl having a cursh on him is not just cruel, but also very disencouraging, it
is anti progressive too.
		
		Movie timing 14.34 - 20.30 gives a sample of his charmatic effects. 
Itouness - 30%


4. Nidoran M and F Ralf, Emily, Tony and Maria - from Pokemon season 2, ep '20' 

	Reason: 
		For being so cruel to each other until before the rushed, simple ending. For a kid who daily waits for watching a pokemon
episode, this is a disaster, as instead of getting intense, developing battles by chalie(I mean, charmander), the boy, this makes a lecturing series only meant for kids who don't take pokemon seriously. 
The absence of charmander is notable. Nidoran has a mate, what about for charlie ?? And what if they are schools of thought, love shouldn't erase the borders. They are supposed to preserve, the clear distinctions, that are formed over a course of many years. Love has no business, interfering.
